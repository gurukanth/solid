LSP:
You should change things without breaking things.

The elements of a system can be replaced with newer implementations without breaking the system itself.

if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted with any object of a subtype S) 
without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).
